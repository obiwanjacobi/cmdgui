The Command Line Gui definition xml file contains the information the Command Line Gui application needs to generate a GUI. It basically contains 3 sections:
* Information about the executable and its command line arguments.
* Information about how those command line arguments are (re)presented in the GUI.
* And a list of executable exit codes to determine if an operation was successful.
It is possible to define multiple executables in one .gui file.
