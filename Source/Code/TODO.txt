- SvcUtil
- Robo Copy
- STSAdmin
- C# Compiler
- git

- Check control (that optionally attaches to an argument) that enables another group of bindings.
  When no argument is coupled a GroupBinding should be used. 
  When an argument IS coupled a ValueBinding should be used. 
  But this introduces children to the ValueBinding - which we do not support.

- Multi-select options control (GroupBinding)

- Dependency StateTable.
  Allows the availability of options to depend on the value of other options.

- A .gui generator tool that parses the console output to generate the definition file (perhaps an excel add-in).

- ordinals on BindingGroup.

- allow a gui to be defined over multiple files (identified by exe name).

- allow multiple uses of the same argument to contain the same value in the UI (shared group/scope name)

- Implement custom binding and binding-group control support.

- implement custom attrs on argument and overrides by binding(group) control attrs.

- automatic period detection in description texts inserting new-line characters.

- support collapse on (display) group bindings.

- Guid input control.

- Password input control

- Date-Time input control
